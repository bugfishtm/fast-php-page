## PHP Functions
Discover a collection of indispensable PHP functions crafted for seamless integration across various projects. Witness how these functions expedite and refine coding processes within web development. Comprehensive documentation for each function is provided below. To incorporate these functions seamlessly, include the PHP files within the designated _functions subfolder in the overarching _framework folder. This strategic approach optimizes coding efficiency and enhances web project performance.

## PHP Classes
These classes, located in /_framework/classes/x_*, are crucial for their functionality, efficiency, and thorough testing across various websites. They enhance development and save time. Note: Some classes require a database connection. They will install necessary tables automatically if configured correctly. Not all classes require MySQL; refer to the documentation for specific requirements. If MySQL is needed, provide a valid x_class_mysql object to the class.
