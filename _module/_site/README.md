üìÅ **Website Modules Folder**

The **Site Modules** directory houses modules installed by the store module or uploaded manually. These modules are accessible via the integrated admin panel or by adjusting the `cfg_ruleset.php` file.

### Caution When Renaming Folders
- Renaming folders can cause loss of relations to other site modules in _restricted/_public or _internal/_domains.
- Only rename Site Module Folders manually if you understand the implications.
- The Administrator Module has tools to find lost data.

**Setting Up Standalone Module Pages**
- Use cfg_ruleset.php in the website's root folders to access deep CMS functionalities.

**Important Rules**
- Do not start a site module name with a number.
- Do not start a site module name with _ (reserved for core modules).
- Only use alphanumeric characters.
- Module names and folder names should not exceed 10 characters.

**Note:** Changes in this folder are persistent and will not be overwritten by core updates.

Happy coding and have a great one!
