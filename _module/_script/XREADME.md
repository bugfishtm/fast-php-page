üìÅ **Script Modules Repository**

Modules usable independently of any website module.  
You can also find downloadable Script Modules in the Store!

|        | - Move the extracted folder, containing files like version.php (...), to the _internal/_inactive/_script/ directory of the bugfishCMS Installation. Ensure that no special signs are used in the scripts folder name. The only special character allowed in an scripts folder name is _, but only as the first letter. |
