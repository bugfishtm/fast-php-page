| 1      | **Upload in Administrator Module**                                                                                                                                                      |
|        | - Open the Administrator Module of your bugfishCMS Instance in your web browser.                                                                                                         |
|        | - Log in as Administrator or Privileged user to control Modules/Extensions.                                                                                                               |
|        | - Go to the Store area and choose "Upload Manually" from the top bar.                                                                                                                     |
|        | - Select your obtained module's .zip file and upload it by choosing the file in the file browser that appears upon clicking "choose file".                                                 |
|        | - The Site module will now be installed as a template.                                                                                                                                    |
|        | - Navigate to the Site Modules Section.                                                                                                                                                   |
|        | - Install the newly uploaded Site Module Template with a desired Name. It will be installed and activated. It is recommended to open the site module once to initialize the site module's required data and variables in the database. |

|        | - Log in to your web server with FTP/SFTP.                                                                                                                                               |
|        | - Unpack the required Site Modules folder.                                                                                                                                               |
|        | - Move the extracted folder, containing files like version.php (...), to the _site directory of the bugfishCMS Installation. Ensure that no special signs are used in the site folder name. The only special character allowed in a site module's folder name is _, but only as the first letter. |
|        | - You can now use the site module by navigating to it using the administrator module or by using the ./developer.php script to choose the new site Module. If you are using ./developer.php, ensure that this script is activated in cfg_ruleset.php; otherwise, you will receive an error message with more details. |
