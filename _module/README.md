📁 **Example Modules Repository**

This folder houses modules for development, testing, or use, split into three sections:

**1. Site Modules:** Full website modules capable of acting standalone.

**2. Extension Modules:** Modules applicable to website modules, enhancing their functionality.

**3. Script Modules:** Modules usable independently of any website module.

Feel free to explore and utilize these modules to enhance your projects!
