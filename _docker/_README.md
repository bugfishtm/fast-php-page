# Apache2 Configuration Files

**This content serves the vhost files for a docker deployed bugfishCMS instance!**


This folder contains configuration files for Apache2 server settings. Changes made to these configuration files may require either a Docker container restart or an Apache2 service restart for the modifications to take effect.

## Notes on Configuration Changes

When altering any configuration files within this directory, be aware of the following:

- **Apache2 Configuration Changes**: Adjustments to these files can impact the behavior and settings of the Apache2 server.
- **Docker Container Restart**: If Apache2 configurations are within a Docker container, modifications might require restarting the Docker container to apply the changes.
- **Apache2 Service Restart**: If the Apache2 service resides on the host machine, alterations to these configuration files might necessitate restarting the Apache2 service for the changes to be recognized.

## Instructions for Restart

### Docker Container Restart

If the Apache2 configurations are within a Docker container:

1. **Stop the Docker Container**: Use the appropriate Docker commands to stop the container.
2. **Start the Docker Container**: Restart the Docker container to apply the updated configurations.

### Apache2 Service Restart

If Apache2 is running directly on the host machine:

1. **Restart Apache2 Service**: Execute the command to restart the Apache2 service after modifying the configuration files.
```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```
