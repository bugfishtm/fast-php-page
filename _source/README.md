## What is this project about?  
This repository hosts a framework that is not a complete, out-of-the-box CMS (Content Management System) that can be easily set up in the frontend. Instead, it is designed for individuals with coding expertise who wish to develop their own modules. While there are built-in functionalities available in the administrator interface for various purposes, the primary emphasis of this system lies in its extensibility. Users are encouraged to create and integrate site modules to tailor the framework to their specific requirements, making it a flexible and adaptable solution for those who have the technical skills to harness its potential.

## Initial Login
If you are using user login functionality, the initial created user for the backend is as follow:  
**Username**: admin@admin.local

**Username**: admin  
**Password**: changeme  

**Do change your administrative password after login to close this potential security leak**
