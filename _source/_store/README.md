# Store API Files

The Store API Files directory contains files generated by an administrator module to facilitate a store for other bugfishCMS instances. This directory is exclusively utilized if the current viewed instance functions as a store instance, enabling other bugfishCMS instances to download modules from this repository.

Files within this folder remain unaffected by core updates. However, they may be subject to overwriting by administration interfaces managing store functionality. 

- The `update.php` file is responsible for distributing the latest version utilized by this CMS. You can configure this functionality by providing a serialized array with the necessary data. Refer to the administrator site module for a sample and adapt it to modify this functionality.

- The `store.php` file serves to furnish information for the store. When other instances inquire about available modules, this file outputs a serialized array containing available modules.

This folder is publicly accessible, and all files within it can be downloaded by anyone. Therefore, refrain from sharing non-public or commercial modules through this functionality. While originally developed to disseminate public modules, you are encouraged to leverage this functionality to meet your specific requirements on your instances.
