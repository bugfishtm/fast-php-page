# Store Interface Files

The Store API Files directory contains files generated by an administrator module to facilitate a store for other BugfishCMS instances. This directory is exclusively utilized if the current instance functions as a store instance, enabling other BugfishCMS instances to download modules from this repository.

## Usage

- **update.php**: Responsible for distributing the latest version utilized by this CMS. Configure this functionality by providing a serialized array with the necessary data. Refer to the administrator site module for a sample and adapt it to modify this functionality.

- **store.php**: Furnishes information for the store. When other instances inquire about available modules, this file outputs a serialized array containing available modules.

Happy Storing!
