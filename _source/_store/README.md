# Store API Files

The Store API Files directory contains files generated by an administrator module to facilitate a store for other Fast-PHP-Page instances. This directory is exclusively utilized if the current viewed instance functions as a store instance, enabling other Fast-PHP-Page instances to download modules from this repository.

Files within this folder remain unaffected by core updates. However, they may be subject to overwriting by administration interfaces managing store functionality. 

- The `update.php` file is responsible for distributing the latest version utilized by this CMS. You can configure this functionality by providing a serialized array with the necessary data. Refer to the administrator site module for a sample and adapt it to modify this functionality.

- The `store.php` file serves to furnish information for the store. When other instances inquire about available modules, this file outputs a serialized array containing available modules.

This folder is publicly accessible, and all files within it can be downloaded by anyone. Therefore, refrain from sharing non-public or commercial modules through this functionality. While originally developed to disseminate public modules, you are encouraged to leverage this functionality to meet your specific requirements on your instances.
