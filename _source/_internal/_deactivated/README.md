# Deactivated Site Modules

This directory is designated for storing deactivated site modules that are waiting to be redeployed. Modules can be reactivated through the admin interface or by manually copying them back to the parent folder.

**Deactivation Process:**
- When a site module is deactivated, it is moved to this directory.
- Deactivation can be done through the admin interface or manually by administrators.

**Reactivation Options:**
1. **Admin Interface:**
   - Visit the admin panel to reactivate modules selectively.
   - Enable or configure modules based on your requirements.

2. **Manual Reactivation:**
   - Copy the desired module folders back to the parent directory to reactivate them.
   - Ensure correct permissions for the module folders and files.

**Important Notes:**
- Deactivated modules do not contribute to the website's functionality.
- Modules in this directory can be considered as "paused" until reactivated.

**Caution:**
- Exercise caution when reactivating modules to prevent conflicts or unexpected behavior.
- Regularly check for updates or compatibility issues after reactivating modules.
