üìÅ **Captcha Folder**

The CAPTCHA Files directory contains PHP files designed for CAPTCHA functionality inclusion in projects. These CAPTCHAs can be displayed using an HTML image tag, with the session key containing the code as `_HIVE_SITE_COOKIE_."captcha.XXXX"`.

**Usage:**
- Integrate the CAPTCHA PHP files into your project to enable CAPTCHA functionality.
- Display the CAPTCHA image using an HTML image tag with the appropriate source.

**Integration:**
- Ensure proper configuration of session handling in your project.
- Utilize the session key `_HIVE_SITE_COOKIE_."captcha.XXXX"` to link CAPTCHA codes with user sessions.

**Note:** Changes in this folder are NOT persistent and will be overwritten by core updates.

Happy coding and have a great one!
