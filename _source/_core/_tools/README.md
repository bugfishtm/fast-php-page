The Development Tools directory hosts tools utilized during development, accessible when the `_HIVE_ALLOW_TOOLS_` flag is activated in the `ruleset.php` file.

**Usage:**
- Activate the `_HIVE_ALLOW_TOOLS_` flag in the `ruleset.php` file to enable the utilization of development tools.
- Utilize the tools provided here for debugging, profiling, or other development purposes.

**Important Notes:**
- Use these tools responsibly and solely in a development environment.
- Ensure tools are regularly updated to maintain compatibility with the current codebase.

**Activation:**
- Set `_HIVE_ALLOW_TOOLS_` to `true` in the `ruleset.php` file to enable the use of development tools.

**Caution:**

Enabling development tools streamlines debugging and profiling processes during development, while ensuring security in production environments.
