# Additional Website Files and Cache

**DO NOT MODIFY FILES WITHIN THIS FOLDER, AS THEY MAY BE OVERWRITTEN DURING CORE UPDATES!**

**Caching Files:**
- Initialization files and various caching and lockfiles.

**Important Notes:**
- Refrain from modifying or deleting files unless their purpose is fully understood.
- Document the purpose of additional files for future reference.
